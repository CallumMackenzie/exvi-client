From bodybuilders to powerlifters, the bench press is a staple chest exercise in nearly every workout program.\nFor powerlifters, it is known as one of the “big three” lifts which includes the squat, deadlift, and bench press. For athletes, 1 rep max on bench press is a good indicator for on field/court performance. And for bodybuilders, the bench press is a compound exercise that targets many of the muscles in your upper body.\nBy performing the bench press, you primarily work your pectoralis major (your chest). Other muscles which assist in moving the barbell during a bench press are other muscles of the chest, triceps, and shoulders.\nNot everyone is built to perform the traditional barbell bench press, so several variations have been created to ensure people can train this crucial movement pattern in a safe and comfortable way.\nSome of these variations include:\nIncline bench press\nDecline bench press,\nDumbbell bench press\nDumbbell incline bench press\nDumbbell decline bench press\nSmith machine bench press\nThose with shoulder injuries can also utilize many of the alternative barbells out there that place less pressure on the shoulder to bench press.

They can also be helpful for those who powerlift, as the accommodating resistance provided by the bands and kettlebells will help lifts train through their sticking points.\n","muscleWorkData":[{"muscle":"CHEST","workCoeff":1.0}],"exerciseTypes":["STRENGTH"],"experienceLevel":"ADVANCED","mechanics":"COMPOUND","forceType":"PUSH","equipment":[{"name":"Barbell"}]},{"name":"Push Up with Knee Drive","description":"Assume a quadruped position on the floor with your hands under your shoulders, toes tucked, and knees under hips.\nExtend one leg at a time and assume a push up position with the legs straight, elbows extended, and head in a neutral position looking at the floor.\nSlowly descend to the floor by retracting the shoulder blades and unlocking the elbows.\nDescend until the upper arms are parallel or your chest touches the floor.\nPush back to the starting point by extending the elbows and driving your palms into the floor.\nDrive your knee towards your chest, slowly lower back to the starting position and then repeat on the opposite side.\nRepeat for the desired number of repetitions.\nPush Up with Knee Drive Tips\nYour arms should resemble an arrow in the bottom position, not a “T”.\nYour spine should remain rigid throughout the entire exercise, think of the push up as a moving plank.\nSqueeze your glutes and brace your abs before descending to keep the ribcage neutral.\nKeep the chin down and don’t look forward.\nImagine you’re trying to push your thumbs together while completing the movement, this will improve activation of the pecs.\nDon’t allow the head to jut forward, the chest should touch at the same time as your nose.\nThink about trying to push yourself as far away from the floor as possible.\nEnsure you push all the way through the floor at the top of the repetition and allow your shoulder blades to move around your ribcage.\nMost folks cut the repetition short and don’t garner the full benefits.\n","videoLink":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ElzJmvP68u4?rel\u003d0","tips":"","overview":"The push up with knee drive is a combination movement that combines both a push up and a knee drive.\nThe push up portion of the push up with knee drives targets the muscles of the chest, shoulders, and triceps.

If you find the your weight on the toes when at the bottom position of the exercise, you are performing it incorrectly.\nDo not relax at the bottom of the movement. Keep your legs, back and abdominals tight as you begin the ascent.\nKeep the rep timing slow and control the weight, especially when lowering. Remember the focus is on stretch and contraction!\nOne of the biggest mistakes people make when performing this exercise is bending over at the waist without moving the hips back. Instead of being supported by the large hamstring muscles, the weight is now placed almost entirely on the lower spine. Needless to say, this puts your back at great risk for injury. If you keep the weight close to your body your hips with naturally move back.\nTechnique is so important with this exercise. If you\u0027re just starting out, stand with your side to a mirror with a very light weight and practice the movement. Once you get the technique nailed you\u0027ll be able to move up in weight and start building some killer hams and glutes!\n","overview":"","muscleWorkData":[{"muscle":"HAMSTRINGS","workCoeff":1.0}],"exerciseTypes":["STRENGTH"],"experienceLevel":"BEGINNER","mechanics":"COMPOUND","forceType":"PULL","equipment":[{"name":"Dumbbell"}]},{"name":"Leg Curl","description":"The lying leg curl is a great exercise to isolate the hamstrings.

If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights.\nIn order to prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats in order to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.\nThe hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.\nIdeally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length.\nToe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.\nDo NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.\nMake sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.\nScraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.\nTo follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.\nMore experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.\nFor single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.\nThe knees should be stacked over the feet. If you position the feet too wide (outside of hip width) then you will likely have to resort to one of two strategies:\nThe knees will be pushed inward (valgus) due to your grip width.\nYou will have to widen your grip which will require a larger range of motion and make the lift less efficient.\nIf you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts. You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes.\n","videoLink":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wjsu6ceEkAQ?rel\u003d0","tips":"","overview":"The deadlift is an extremely popular exercise and a true test of total body strength. It is popular across numerous weight lifting circle including bodybuilders, powerlifts, and Crossfit athletes.\nThe deadlift focuses on lifting dead weight off the ground to hip level without using momentum to assist the weight on its path up. It is known as one of the “big three” exercises for powerlifters which includes squats, bench press, and the deadlift. Bodybuilders use the deadlift to promote muscle growth in their entire posterior chain (muscles on the back of the body).\nThe deadlift primarily works the muscles of the hamstrings. However, it is a complete compound exercise and also requires muscle activation from the back, glutes, hamstrings, arms, and core.\nThe conventional deadlift shouldn’t be performed by just anyone as it involves a lot of technique and skill to execute. However, the hip-hinge movement pattern trained while performing a deadlift is and should be included in every workout program.\nFor those who cannot deadlift using the conventional pulling method, they can perform the exercise using one of the many deadlift variations out there.\nSome of these deadlift variations include:\nTrap Bar Deadlift\nRomanian Deadlift\nStiff Leg Deadlift\nLandmine Deadlift\nDumbbell Deadlift\nSmith Machine Deadlift\nGrip strength is key to being able to deadlift a lot of weight and there are several grip variations you can use while deadlifting including: an overhand grip, mixed grip, and the hook grip.\n","muscleWorkData":[{"muscle":"HAMSTRINGS","workCoeff":1.0}],"exerciseTypes":["STRENGTH"],"experienceLevel":"INTERMEDIATE","mechanics":"COMPOUND","forceType":"HINGE","equipment":[{"name":"Barbell"}]},{"name":"Stiff Leg Deadlift","description":"Position the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a hip width stance.\nPush your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.\nReach down and grasp the bar using a shoulder width, double overhand grip.\nEnsure your spine is neutral, shin is vertical, and your hips are roughly the same height as your shoulders.\nDrive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.\nEnsure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.\nOnce you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.\nReturn the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.\nStiff Leg Deadlift Tips\nThis style of deadlift will look VERY similar to a conventional deadlift only the lifter will start with higher hips and a vertical shin angle.

This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.\nAs you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.\nDrive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.\nEnsure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.\nOnce you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.\nReturn the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.\nTrap Bar Deadlift Tips\nStance width should ideally resemble your typical jumping position. Place your feet in a stance that feels powerful and keeps the knees vertically aligned over the feet.\nIn order to prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats in order to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.\nThe hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.\nIdeally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.\nYou MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot in order to allow the bar to travel linearly.\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.\nGiven most deadlift variations require a more vertical shin after the initial pull off the floor to allow the bar to move around the knees, the trap bar deadlift will actually require a more dorsiflexed position of the ankle at the start. In other words, the shins will be in a more angled position and more of the load will be displaced on the quads.\nMore experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.\nToe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.\nDo NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.\nMake sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.\nEnsure that the hands are positioned in the middle of the handles as this will ensure that the bar doesn’t tilt as you make your pull.\nTo follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.\nFor single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.\nIf you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts. You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes.\n","videoLink":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-bSCG8ARHSk?rel\u003d0","tips":"","overview":"The trap bar deadlift is a variation of the deadlift and an exercise used primarily to target the muscles of the hamstrings.

Place your feet in a stance that feels powerful and keeps the knees vertically aligned over the feet.\nTo prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.\nThe hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.\nIdeally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.\nYou MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.\nGiven most deadlift variations require a more vertical shin after the initial pull off the floor to allow the bar to move around the knees, the trap bar deadlift will actually require a more dorsiflexed position of the ankle at the start. In other words, the shins will be in a more angled position and more of the load will be displaced on the quads.\nMore experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.\nToe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.\nDo NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.\nMake sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.\nEnsure that the hands are positioned in the middle of the handles as this will ensure that the bar doesn’t tilt as you make your pull.\nIf you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.\nFor single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.\n","videoLink":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRqLflXwJEM?rel\u003d0","tips":"","overview":"The trap bar deadlift against chains is a variation of the trap bar deadlift and an exercise used to strengthen the muscles of the hamstrings, glutes, lats, and lower back.\nBy incorporating the use of chains, you provide variable resistance during the lift.

This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.\nAs you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.\nDrive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.\nEnsure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.\nOnce you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.\nReturn the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.\nSumo Block Pull Deadlift Tips\nUsing blocks allows you to overload the top half of the range of motion given the shortened range of motion.\nStance width varies greatly depending upon the individual. Rather than spend too much time trying to calculate your ideal stance width, simply experiment and see what feels best on your hips in the long run while simultaneously allowing you to generate the most power. For some folks this will be a semi medium width (hybrid) position whereas for others their toes will almost be touching the plates.\nThe sumo pull is slightly different than conventional as the goal is to “wedge” your hips into the bar and get them as close as possible.\nTo prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.\nThe hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.\nIdeally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.\nYou MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.\nIdeally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin, especially in the sumo deadlift.\nMore experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.\nToe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly out or neutral) to see what feels best for you.\nDo NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.\nMake sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.\nScraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.\nIf you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out.

However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.\nIf you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts. You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes.\n","videoLink":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LZoNglnQeaI?rel\u003d0","tips":"","overview":"The sumo block pull deadlift is a variation of the sumo deadlift and an exercise used to strengthen the muscles of the hamstrings, glutes, lats, and lower back.\nBy shortening the range of motion, as seen in sumo block pull deadlifts, you can overload the top portion of the movement.

You could also attach them to the end of the bar on both ends using clamps. Either option is viable but depending upon what equipment is available, you may have to adapt your chain positioning.\nBy adding chains to the bar you will allow yourself to overload the top half of the movement given that the chains will elongate and add the most weight at the top of the movement. This allows you to use a weight you might not be able to manage for a full repetition normally but given the variable resistance from the chain, you are able to overload the lockout without getting off the floor.\nYou MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.\nThe deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights.\nTo prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.\nThe hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”).

Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.\nDo NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.\nMake sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.\nScraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.\nTo follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.\nMore experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.\nFor single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.\nThe knees should be stacked over the feet. If you position the feet too wide (outside of hip width) then you will likely have to resort to one of two strategies:\nThe knees will be pushed inward (valgus) due to your grip width.\nYou will have to widen your grip which will require a larger range of motion and make the lift less efficient.\nIf you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts.

This staggered stance can provide a straighter bar path for some in comparison to the conventional deadlift.\n","muscleWorkData":[{"muscle":"HAMSTRINGS","workCoeff":1.0}],"exerciseTypes":["STRENGTH"],"experienceLevel":"INTERMEDIATE","mechanics":"COMPOUND","forceType":"HINGE","equipment":[{"name":"Barbell"}]},{"name":"Reverse Band Deadlift","description":"Once the bar has been loaded, attach bands to the top of the rack via pegs or the actual rack itself and then anchor the end of the bands around the bar to provide assistance.\nPosition the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a hip width stance.\nPush your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.\nReach down and grasp the bar using a shoulder width, double overhand grip.\nInhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion.

This allows you to use a weight you might not be able to manage for a full repetition normally but given the assistance from the band, you are able to overload the lockout without getting stuck off the floor.\nIdeally you would want to attach two bands across the bar using pegs on a deadlift platform or rack. However, if that option isn’t available, you can simply loop a single band around the end, stretch it underneath the plates, and then loop it around the other side.\nIf that isn’t comfortable, you can also stand on one end of the band, wrap it around the bar, and step on the other end. This option is slightly more dangerous though as there is a good chance that the band might slide out from underneath your feet and present a potential injury risk.

If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights.\nTo prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.\nThe hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up.

However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.\nThe knees should be stacked over the feet. If you position the feet too wide (outside of hip width) then you will likely have to resort to one of two strategies:\nThe knees will be pushed inward (valgus) due to your grip width.\nYou will have to widen your grip which will require a larger range of motion and make the lift less efficient.\nIf you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands.

If you are squatting correctly, you should not feel pain in your lower back. Lower back pain is usually a sign that you are not using correct form and/or your core is weak.  \nCommon mistakes when squatting:\nRounding the lower back: It\u0027s crucially important that you keep a straight back when you squat! You can ensure your back is straight by keeping your eyes facing forward, chest out, shoulder blades back, and back arched. Keep your core muscles tensed throughout the movement to help hold your back in place.\nPushing from the balls of your feet: This puts unnecessary strain on joints and tendons. Always push up through your heels. Curling up your toes can help you get the technique right.\nLeaning forward: This happens when your hips move up faster than your shoulders. To prevent this keep the rep timing slow and controlled and stick your buttocks out as you go down.\nKnees come too far forward: When you squat down, your hips should be dropping straight down, not coming forward. Using a light weight, perfect your form standing side on to a mirror. Your knees should never track out and over your toes.\nNot squatting deep enough: Using squats to their full potential requires squatting down at least until your thighs are around parallel to the floor.\nKnees in or out: Don\u0027t point your knees in or out when you\u0027re lowering or pushing the weight. This puts unnecessary strain on the knee joints.\nLooking down: As soon as you look down your back rounds, simple as that.\n","videoLink":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/R2dMsNhN3DE?rel\u003d0","tips":"","overview":"The squat is the king of all exercises, working over 256 muscles in one movement! From bodybuilders to powerlifters to competitive athletes, the squat is a staple compound exercise and should be in every workout plan.\nFor powerlifters, it is known as one of the “big three” lifts which includes the squat, deadlift, and bench press. For athletes, having an explosive squat is a good indicator for on field/court performance. And for bodybuilders, the squat is a compound exercise that targets nearly every muscle of your lower body and core.\nThe squat directly targets the muscles of the quads, but also involves the hamstrings, glutes, back, and core as well as muscles of the shoulders and arms to a lesser degree.\nNot everyone is built to perform the traditional barbell back squat and it can result in some pain for certain individuals. Over the years, several squatting variations have been developed to help everyone be able to train this critical movement pattern safely.\nSome of the squat variations include:\nBodyweight Squat\nGoblet Squat\nLandmine Squat\nFront Squat\nDumbbell Squat\nMachine Hack Squat\nSmith Machine Squat\nThe emphasis of the squat can be switched from the quads to the hamstrings by your foot placement. Some wear shoes with an elevated heel (or elevate their heels on plates) to focus more on the quads. Others keep a flat foot to put more pressure on the hamstrings.\nAt the end of the day it is important that you pick a squat variation and foot placement that works best for you and that you can perform safely.\nWant to improve your squat?

Don’t mistake compensation for improvement.\nYou can use these drills as “fillers” in between your large compound movements or you can implement them within your warm up as a method of potentiating your central nervous system for heavier strength based work in your accompanying training session.\nUnilateral versions should only be incorporated once someone demonstrates substantial levels of lower body strength and stability.\nThe arms drive the legs, don’t forget to incorporate the arm swing.\nMake sure you step down from the box, don’t jump down.\nLand softly - use the cue “extend (as in the hips), absorb”.\n","videoLink":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MX-NHcqEqQk?rel\u003d0","tips":"","overview":"The box jump is an exercise used to increase lower body explosiveness.\nPlyometric exercises, such as the box jump, are not only important for athletes – but also the general population as well to maintain elasticity in your tendons as you age.

If you are squatting correctly, you should not feel pain in your lower back. Lower back pain is usually a sign that you are not using correct form and/or your core is weak.  \nCommon mistakes when squatting:  \nRounding the lower back: It\u0027s crucially important that you keep a straight back when you squat! You can ensure your back is straight by keeping eyes facing forward, chest out, shoulder blades back, and back arched. Keep your core muscles tensed throughout the movement to help hold your back in place.\nPushing from the balls of your feet: This puts unnecessary strain on joints and tendons. Always push up through your heels. Curling up your toes can help you get the technique right.\nLeaning forward: This happens when your hips move up faster than your shoulders. To prevent this, keep the rep timing slow and controlled and stick your buttocks out as you go down.\nKnees come too far forward: When you squat down your hips should be dropping straight down, not coming forward. Using a light weight, perfect your form standing side on to a mirror.\nNot squatting deep enough: Using squats to their full potential requires squatting down at least until your thighs are around parallel to the floor.\nKnees in or out: Don\u0027t point your knees in or when you\u0027re lowering or pushing the weight.

Don’t mistake compensation for improvement.\nYou can use these drills as “fillers” in between your large compound movements or you can implement them within your warm up as a method of potentiating your central nervous system for heavier strength based work in your accompanying training session.\nUnilateral versions should only be incorporated once someone demonstrates substantial levels of lower body strength and stability.\nThe arms drive the legs, don’t forget to incorporate the arm swing.\nMake sure you step down from the box, don’t jump down.\nLand softly - use the cue “extend (as in the hips), absorb”.\n","videoLink":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eszrCjMV_CY?rel\u003d0","tips":"","overview":"The 2 to 1 box jump is a variation of the box jump and an exercise used to increase lower body explosiveness.\nPlyometric exercises, such as the 2 to 1 box jump, are not only important for athletes – but also the general population as well to maintain elasticity in your tendons as you age.\n","muscleWorkData":[{"muscle":"QUADRICEPS","workCoeff":1.0}],"exerciseTypes":["PLYOMETRIC"],"experienceLevel":"BEGINNER","mechanics":"COMPOUND","forceType":"PUSH","equipment":[{"name":"Box"}]},{"name":"Muscle Snatch","description":"Position the bar over the knot on your shoelaces but not touching your shins.\nSetup with your feet in a shoulder width stance, toes pointed out slightly, and your hands in a snatch grip.\nDrop your hips and drive the chest up while looking forward.\nKeeping the bar close to your body, begin to push the floor away and shift your knees back.\nAs the bar passes your knees, shift your knees forward into a power position with your torso upright.\nExplosively jump straight up and shrug the bar aggressively.\nAs the bar passes your shoulders, flip the elbows and press the bar to extension.\nReverse the movement by flipping the wrists, unbending the elbows, and catching the bar at the crease of your hip before lowering to the floor.\nRepeat for the desired number of repetitions.\nMuscle Snatch Tips\nOlympic lifting is about efficiency, not just brute strength.\nUse this simple jingle to help groove the necessary positions for the snatch:\nStarting position\nKnees back\nKnees forward\nJump and shrug\nThink “slow off the floor, fast into the hips”.\nMuscle snatches don’t require the lifter to squat and catch the movement.

If the elbows are bent then you will load the hips more as you effectively take the upper back out of the equation given you’re shortening the lever arm and taking the shoulders out of flexion. If you keep the elbows locked out then you will have to fight for more thoracic extension during the movement. Neither is right or wrong, just depends on what you’re looking to accomplish.\nRemember, with a sprint the goal should be technical proficiency and speed under some load. Not maximal load, some load. Keep it light enough that it doesn’t affect your technique.\nIf you find the front of the sled digging into the floor then you may need to grip slightly lower on the handles and/or ensure that your torso is inclined properly. If you start to get too upright then the sled will likely tilt forward and you’ll increase drag against the floor.\nIf you don’t have access to a sled, you can push a car or even a plate across astroturf.\nSome prefer to push with the head down while others would rather look up. This is somewhat personal preference but it will also depend upon the individual and how they present in a resting position.\nIf someone exhibits more extension bias then they may want to experiment with looking down as this will help to keep them a bit more neutral.\nIf someone exhibits more flexion bias then they may want to experiment with looking up as this will help to drive more extension and keep them a bit more neutral.\nGiven sled pushes/drags don’t have any eccentric component they can very beneficial to incorporate during rehab, as a method of conditioning which won’t incur excessive soreness or load joints excessively.\n","videoLink":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TxfI6jVViF8?rel\u003d0","tips":"","overview":"The sled sprint is a variation of the sled push and an exercise used to strengthen the muscle of the quads, glutes and hamstrings.\nAs you push, the sled will put concentric tension on the muscles used – making it a perfect exercise for those rehabbing injury, as you don’t have to worry about the eccentric motion of the lift.\nSled pushes can be an extremely beneficial conditioning exercise or they can be used as a strength building exercise depending on how you fit them into your workout routine.\n","muscleWorkData":[{"muscle":"QUADRICEPS","workCoeff":1.0}],"exerciseTypes":["CONDITIONING"],"experienceLevel":"BEGINNER","mechanics":"COMPOUND","forceType":"PUSH","equipment":[{"name":"Sled"}]},{"name":"Speed Squats","description":"Set up for the exercise by setting the barbell to just below shoulder height and loading the weight you want to use. \nStand under the bar with your feet at about shoulder width apart.\nPosition the bar so that it is resting on the muscles on the top of your back, not on the back of your neck.

Rather than spending too much time trying to calculate your ideal stance width, simply experiment and see what feels best on your hips in the long run while simultaneously allowing you to generate the most power. For some folks this will be a semi medium width (hybrid) position whereas for others their toes will very wide.\nThe hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.\nIdeally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.\nIdeally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin, especially in the sumo deadlift.\nToe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly out or neutral) to see what feels best for you.\nDo NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.\nMake sure you wrap your thumbs around the kettlebell and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the handle as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the kettlebell.\nIf you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.\n","videoLink":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-VRgsXVURZM?rel\u003d0","tips":"","overview":"The 1 KB kettlebell sumo deadlift high pull is a variation of the clean and an exercise used primarily to target the muscles of the shoulders and traps.\nThe 1 KB kettlebell sumo deadlift high pull is a combination exercise (combining a sumo deadlift with a high pull) and will target other muscles groups such as the upper back and hamstrings.\nHigh pulls are performed explosively, and since the traps respond well to explosive movements, will help with trap muscle growth.

This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.\nAs you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.\nDrive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.\nAs the bar nears your hips and your legs lock out, shrug the shoulders and then pull aggressively with the arms.\nThe bar should rise to sternum level at the completion of the movement.\nAs the bar returns back to the hip position, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.\nReturn the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.\nSumo High Pull Tips\nStance width varies greatly depending upon the individual. Rather than spend too much time trying to calculate your ideal stance width, simply experiment and see what feels best on your hips in the long run while simultaneously allowing you to generate the most power. For some folks this will be a semi medium width (hybrid) position whereas for others their toes will almost be touching the plates.\nThe sumo pull is slightly different than conventional as the goal is to “wedge” your hips into the bar and get them as close as possible.\nTo prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats in order to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.\nThe hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.\nIdeally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.\nYou MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.\nIdeally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin, especially in the sumo deadlift.\nToe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly out or neutral) to see what feels best for you.\nDo NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.\nMake sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.\nScraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.\nIf you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.\n","videoLink":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/U_8okzWkU7E?rel\u003d0","tips":"","overview":"The sumo stance high pull is a variation of the high pull and an exercise used primarily to target the muscles of the shoulders and traps.\nThe sumo high pull is somewhat of a combination exercise (combining a sumo deadlift with an upright row) and will target other muscles groups such as the upper back and hamstrings.\nHigh pulls are performed explosively, and since the traps respond well to explosive movements, will help with trap muscle growth.
